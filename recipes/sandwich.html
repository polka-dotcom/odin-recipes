    <p>Love this simple recipe that doesn't involve making a pot roast. I like sliced beef on mine, and am not looking for a pot roast sandwich. We have a store who makes real roast beefs and slices them in the deli, and you can have the doneness to your preference based on how they slice it.I like caramelized onions, swiss, and horseradish on mine. This is great as is, or with your favorite additions!</p>
